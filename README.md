# What are these?
Scripts that I've written that use the userscript editor [Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/). They change the behavior of websites for my own nefarious goals.

# How do I use them?
* Install Tampermonkey
* In `Settings` be sure your Config mode is "beginner" or "Advanced"
* In `Utilities` either select the file you've downloaded or enter the url to the raw file
* Boom!

## Customization
Some scripts, like the deadname replacer, require user input. Once you've imported it go to `Installed userscripts` and edit it. I've left comments to hopefully make it clear but if you need help please let me know.

# "Raw"?
If you're new to Github: click on the file you want and then, above the code, "Raw" from the menu that says "Raw | Blame | History"

# License
These scripts are under the JSON license, which specifies *"The Software shall be used for Good, not Evil."* This is intentional. I understand this means it does not meet the qualifications for "free software". I do not care.

# Who are you?
I'm Dan. Hi.
