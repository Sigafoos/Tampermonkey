# What are these?
Scripts that I've written that use the userscript editor [Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/). They change the behavior of websites for my own nefarious goals.

# How do I use them?
* Install Tampermonkey
* In `Settings` be sure your Config mode is "beginner" or "Advanced"
* In `Utilities` either select the file you've downloaded or enter the url to the raw file
* Boom!

# "Raw"?
If you're new to Github: click on the file you want and then, above the code, "Raw" from the menu that says "Raw | Blame | History"

# Who are you?
I'm Dan. Hi.
